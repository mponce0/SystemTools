# Processes

  * a process is the instance of a computer program that is being executed by one or many threads
  * it contains the program code and its activity
  * depending on the OS, a process may be made up of multiple threads of execution that execute instructions concurrently


## Program vs Processes
  * a computer program is a passive collection of instructions
  * a process is the execution of those instructions after being loaded into memory
  * several processes may be associated with the same program

## Process Representation
In general, a computer system process consists of:
  - An image of the executable machine code associated with a program.
  - Memory Address Space
  - OS descriptors of resources, e.g. file descriptors
  - Security attributes.
  - Processor state (context), such as the content of registers and physical memory addressing.
