# The File System

In a very simplified way the **file system** can be considered as the components of the OS in charge of *managing and administrating files and their corresponding metadata*.

The file system defines how data is stored, accessed, and organized on storage devices.
Different file systems have varying characteristics and are often specific to certain operating systems or devices.

By now, we understand that a "file" is just not the typical construct we have about the data stored on it but also all the information related to it, such as its metadata, and more fundamental aspects like inodes, blocks, etc.

In particular in Unix and Linux type OSes, a file plays a critical role: **any single resource in the computer system is described as a file**.
This unique perspective makes this abstraction at the level of the OS, one of the most powerful ones but also one of the most versatile and useful ones.

In order for the OS to manage files, it employs two critical elements:

## Blocks
   - abstractions of data on the filesystem
   - have a fixed size, determined at the time the filesystem is created
   - the *block size* determines how many bytes are allocated to each block
   - they represent the *minimal unit* of information on the specific filesystem
   - In general, block sizes are 1 KB, 2 KB, or 4 KB for 32-bit systems; and 8 KB is also available on 64-bit systems.

## Inodes (index node)
  - data structure used to map blocks to physical locations in the hardware storage device (e.g. a disk or hard-drive)
  - every single file gets assigned an inode
  - in some way one could think about them as being analogous to pointers
  - when a filesystems runs out of inodes, no new files can be created until existing files are deleted
  - Useful commands to investigate inodes: `ls -i`, `df -i`

      - inodes                |
         / | \            [firmware]
        |  |  |           [drivers/controllers]
        |..|..|               |
        v  v  v               |
      - blocks   ---  ---  ---  --- ---> sectors

```

We should mention the distinction among the "File System" as a component of the OS, and the filesystem actually related to specific storage devices.
This distinction plays a critical role, when in reality you speak to different professional from different fields.
For a system administrator in a typical data center or supercomputer center, it is quite likely that the FS is referring to the actual hardware and supporting drivers or firmware in charge of making it functional and accessible to the OS.

Moreover is possible that a computer system and its corresponding OS, operate on multiple and different types of file systems simultaneously.

```
   [system ]
   [ OS/FS ]
      |  \  \
      |   \  +~~~~(NAT-FS)
      |    +~~~~~~(alien-FS/external-drive)  
(OS-native) 
(filesystem)

```

An example of this are the computer labs accessible for our courses (e.g. IA-3170).
These computer labs usually have mutliple devices available for users to connect and work.
Independently of which machine the user is connecting to, it will always see the same files and file-space --
this is because the very same FS is being **mounted** by all the different machines hence the user
always sees the same file-space in any of these machines.

```
    IA3170-01       IA3170-02       .....       IA3170-39   IA3170-40
    +-------+       +-------+                   +-------+   +-------+
    |       |       |       |                   |       |   |       |
    +-------+       +-------+                   +-------+   +-------+
        \               \                           /           /
         \               \                         /           /
          \...............\.........\     /......./.........../ 
                                    -------
                                   /       \
                                  |  N F S  |
                                   \_______/

```

Importantly, the "view" that the OS And FS have of the files and their associated data is quite different from the one that users or even programs and applications perceive.
From an user perspective, the files, directories, etc. appear as a well organized, hierarchically structured formation -- see the "Typical Linux FS Directory Structure".
However, this is another of the "nice" abstractions and simplified view that the OS in combination with the FS present to users and applications.

A more "realistic view" is the intertwined relationships maintained among inodes, blocks and even sectors; with its corresponding mapping and distributed pointers and links.


### Different type of filesystems:
When talking specifically about the filesystem in terms of the characteristics of how the data and metadata is presented and layout in relation to the hardware, it should be noticed that there are many different types.
The following is an incomplete, but still interesting and representative, list of the different type of filesystems: 
   - FAT:  One of the oldest and simplest file systems. It was initially developed for MS-DOS and is still used in many removable storage devices. The two major versions of this system are FAT16 and FAT32. FAT uses a file allocation table to keep track of file locations on the disk. Used in Windows before NTFS was introduced.
   - exFAT: The extended File Allocation Table (exFAT) builds on FAT32 and offers a lightweight system without all the overhead of NTFS.
   - NTFS: The New Technology File System (NTFS) is the file system that modern Windows versions use by default.
   - HFS+: The Hierarchical File System (HFS+) was the file system older Macs used by default.
   - APFS: The proprietary Apple file system developed as a replacement for HFS+, with a focus on flash drives, SSDs, and encryption.
   - ext2, ext3, & ext4: The extended file system (ext) was the first file system created specifically for the Linux kernel.

   - NAS: Network Attached Storage, involves a server connected to a network providing access to storage resources.

   - GPFS: a General Parallel File System, proprietary FS developed by IBM for HPC or cluster-type systems.
   - Luster: an open-source high-performance parallel FS, developed and mantained by the National Labs in the US


## File Interfaces in C/Unix

There are two main mechanisms for managing open files:
   * File descriptors:
        - these are low-level, managed by OS
        - Each open file is identified by a small integer
        - For instance, `STDIN` is 0, `STDOUT` is 1

   * File pointers:
      - also known as streams or file handles,
      - these are aimed/used for "regular" files
      - A C language construct for easier working with file descriptors
      - You use a pointer to a file structure (`FILE *`) as handle to a file.
      - The file struct contains a file descriptor and a buffer.

### Standard File Descriptors
The operating system (OS) maintains for each process a table with *open file descriptors*, the so-called **file descriptor table**

For each process in the system, the OS automatically opens the three standard file descriptors:

|                 |   Name   |   File Descriptor   |   Default   |
|-----------------|----------|---------------------|-------------|
| Standard Input  | `stdin`  |   0                 |   keyboard  |
| Standard Output | `stdout` |   1                 |   screen    |
| Standard Error  | `stderr` |   2                 |   screen    |


## File System Tables
The OS system will maintain *in-memory structures* to manage and track open files.
It does this by using a combination of of tables and cross-referencing processes, file descriptors and files (using inodes).

Each time a file is opened, a new entry is added to these structures.
The process involves finding the corresponding inode for the given file, check permissions from the metadata and initialize/position the *cursor* at the beginning of the file.

The in-memory structures maintained by the OS are:
   * **Process Control Block**
     
        a table containing the *File Descriptor Table* for each process where every single file opened by the process has an entry

      |  FD |  filename  |
      |-----|------------|
      |  0  |  stdin     |
      |  1  |  stdout    |
      |  2  |  stderr    |
      |  3  |  data.txt  |
      |  4  |  data2.dat |
      | ... |  ...       |
     
* **System-Wide Open File Table**

  The list of all files opened in the system, with its current cursor positioning

     | System-Wide Open Table |
     |------------------------|
     | STDIN                  |
     | STDOUT                 |
     | STDERR                 |
     | data.txt, offset, ...  |
     | data2.txt, offset, ... |
     | ... , ...              |
  
  
* **Vnode Table**
  
  The list of all inodes associated to the open files.
  
     | Vnode Table   |
     |---------------|
     | inode X, ...  |
     | inode Y, ...  |
     | ...           |


A generic and typical "relational" representation would be,

```
[[ Process i ]]
|  Process Control Table  |
|| File Descriptor Table ||
||   0   stdin           ||
||   1   stdout          ||
||   2   stderr          ||            |  System-Wide Open File Table  |        |  Vnode Table     |
||   3   data.txt        ||.......     ||   STDIN                     ||   :--->||  inode X, ...  ||
||   4   data2.dat       ||      :     ||   STDOUT                    ||   :    ||  inode Y, ...  ||
||   5   sample.txt      ||      :     ||   STDERR                    ||   :    ||  inode Z, ...  ||
|-------------------------|      ----->||   data.txt , offset, ...    ||...:    ||   . . .        ||
                                       ||   data2.dat , offset, ...   ||        ||   . . .        ||
[[ Process j ]]                        ||   sample.txt , offset, ...  ||        ||   . . .        ||
|  Process Control Table  |      :---->||   data.bin , offset, ...    ||        |------------------|
|| File Descriptor Table ||      :     ||   data2.dat , offset, ...   ||
||   0   stdin           ||      :     ||   . . .                     ||
||   1   stdout          ||      :     ||   . . .                     ||
||   2   stderr          ||      :     ||   . . .                     ||
||   3   data.bin        ||......:     |-------------------------------|
||   4   data2.dat       ||
|-------------------------|

```


### A Tale of Hierarchies
IOPS are the most expensive operations of any program, hence one must deal with them with caution and in most the cases attempting to minimize them.
The reason why that's the case is because the access to information storage in storage devices is the slowest part in modern computers, even if one considers solid-state devices (SDDs) the typical time frame is going to be orders of magnitudes larger than the number of operations perform by the micro-processor.

```
  speed    #cycles                                           capacity
  fastest   o(1)             registers (RX)                       small       |
    ^       o(10)                 cache                         |         | on-chip

## Typical Linux FS Directory Structure
```sh
/
├── bin -> usr/bin
├── boot
├── dev
├── etc
├── home
├── lib -> usr/lib
├── lib64 -> usr/lib
├── mnt
├── opt
├── proc
├── root
├── run
├── sbin -> usr/bin
├── srv
├── sys
├── tmp
├── usr
└── var
```

The listing above displays the typical directory structure in a Linux-type OS.
As such these directory entries have some standardized meaning and purpose, e.g.
   - `/`: this is known as the "root" directory, o.e. the 'top'-level in the directory structure
   - `/bin`: stands for "binary", and it used to place basic programs and utilities, such as `ls` or `cp`, etc.
   - `/boot`: information about the booting of the system is placed here
   - `/dev`: file representation for devices are located in this directory
   - `/etc`: system-wide configuration files and databases are located here
   - `/home`: location for placing users' home directories
     - `/home/marcelo`
   - `/lib`: contains shared libraries needed by programs in `/bin` or kernel modules
   - `/mnt`: place-holder directory used to "mount" other FS, i.e. a temporary mounting point
   - `/opt`: contains locally installed software
   - `/proc`: a virtual file system ("procfs") containing information about all the currently running processes 
   - `/root`: home directory of the system administrator: super-user (also known as "root", not to be confused with the root of the directory's tree)
   - `/sbin`: super-user binaries (sbin)
   - `/srv`: server data, data for services provided by the system
   - `/sys`: another virtual FS ("sysfs") containing information about the hardware and OS
   - `/tmp`: temporary directory
   - `/usr`: "user" directory aimed to hold executables, libraries, and shared resources that are not system critical
     - `/usr/local`
     - `/usr/share`
   - `/var`: a location to place variable content, i.e. that might change frequently
     - `/var/log`: system logs
