# Glossary

## Algorithm
is a generic prescription or recipe to tackle a particular problem, it does not depend on the details of the implementation; i.e. you can think of it as the general guidelines to solve any problem independent of any particular programming language

## Program
precise series and sequence of instructions given in a particular *programming language*

## Programming Language
Set of instructions, standards, rules and specifications follow to be translated into *machine code* to be executed by the computer.
Examples: Python, C, C++, Java, Fortran, R, C#, etc.

## Function

## Modularity

## Monolithic Code
it referers to the source code of a program which it has been written without any modular implementation, i.e. wihtout function definitions, proper code etiquete such indentation, etc.

## Spaghetti Code
usually a variation on _Monolithic Code_ where not only the code etiquette is not present nbut also indentation is completelly aribitrary making it really hard to follow and read.

## Machine Code (binary code)
Computers can only understand an specific set of instructions, known as **binary code** -- mostly because these are written in binary format (i.e. using 0s and 1s), but sometimes also represented in octal (base-8) or hexadecimal (base-16).

## Source Code


## Script
used to specify the "source code", i.e. the implementation used in *interpreted*-type programming languages.


## Executable

## Compiler
   * standards


## Interpreter

## Compilation
   * Stages/Phases


## Debugger

## Library



## Run-time error


## Memory Model

## Variable

## Boolean

## Floating Point
  - Number
  - Representation

## Overflow

## Underflow

## Operating System (OS)

## Flags

## Arguments

## Terminal

## Command Line
