# Glossary

## Algorithm
is a generic prescription or recipe to tackle a particular problem, it does not depend on the details of the implementation; i.e. you can think of it as the general guidelines to solve any problem independent of any particular programming language

## Program
precise series and sequence of instructions, specifying the actions to be followed by a computer in an specific *programming language*.

## Programming Language
Set of instructions, standards, rules and specifications follow to be translated into *machine code* to be executed by the computer.
Examples: Python, C, C++, Java, Fortran, R, C#, etc.

## Function

## Modularity

## Monolithic Code
it referers to the source code of a program which it has been written without any modular implementation, i.e. wihtout function definitions, proper code etiquete such indentation, etc.

## Spaghetti Code
usually a variation on _Monolithic Code_ where not only the code etiquette is not present nbut also indentation is completelly aribitrary making it really hard to follow and read.

## Machine Code (binary code)
Computers can only understand an specific set of instructions, known as **binary code** -- mostly because these are written in binary format (i.e. using 0s and 1s), but sometimes also represented in octal (base-8) or hexadecimal (base-16).

## Source Code
Named given to a program when the porgramming language used is *compiled* instead of interpreted.

## Script
used to specify the "source code", i.e. the implementation of the prrogram used in *interpreted*-type programming languages.


## Executable

## Compiler
Program used to read and process the *source code* and generate an execurtable that can be run in the computer.

   * standards
   specifying set of instructions and conventions at which a particular programming language would adhere.
   The main rational for defining different standards is to allow the incorporation of new techniques and still remain *back-compatible* with older versions of codes and languages.


## Interpreter
Program used by *interpreted* programming lanuages to read and process line by line the instructions provided.


## Compilation
Process of taking a source code and generate an executable or binary code, that can be run in the computer.
Differently from an interpreter the compiler will read the whole source code, analyze it, check for different type of error, even improve it in some cases, and make sure evrything is proper place and form to generate a valid executable.
   * Stages/Phases:

      In general, there are 3 main compilation stages:

      - *pre-compilation*, where the compiler calls another program named *pre-compiler* to take care of pre-compile declarations, i.e. all instructions that being with "#", suhc as, macro definitions, include statements, etc.
      - *compilation*
      - *linking*
