# Introduction: "Software Tools and Systems Programming"

Welcome!

These are notes related to **Software Tools and Systems Programming** topics.
As such, they include a good number of tools or so-called *utilities* programs (i.e. "Software Tools") which allow us to perform different type of operations related to the system where we run them.
Ranging from monitoring resources, activities to perform specific actions or tasks.

They also include how to program and extract information directly from the operating system running on the computer, i.e. "Systems Programming".
In other words how to employ the resources (APIs) provided by the operating system to users, other programs, etc.

There will be two main elements playing critical and fundamental roles in these notes: the *Operating System* (OS) of the computer/device/system, and in particular the *Unix/Linux OS*.
